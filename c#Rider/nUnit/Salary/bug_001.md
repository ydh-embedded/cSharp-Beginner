# Lösung 

1. Namespace naming convention
   The namespace name Salary should follow the PascalCase convention, which means it should start with a capital letter. I'll rename it to SalaryCalculator.

2. Class and method naming conventions
   The class name T001 is not descriptive and doesn't follow the PascalCase convention. I'll rename it to HealthInsuranceCalculatorTests. The method name TestCalculateHealthInsurance_PositiveValues is a bit long and can be shortened to CalculateHealthInsurance_PositiveValues.

3. Redundant using statements
   The using NUnit.Framework.Legacy; statement is not necessary, as NUnit.Framework already includes the legacy framework.

4. XML comments
   The XML comments are not formatted correctly and are missing some essential information. I'll add proper XML comments to provide a brief description of the class and method.

5. Code organization
   The test method is quite long and can be broken down into smaller, more focused methods. I'll extract the setup and calculation logic into separate methods.

Here's the improved code:

````csharp
using TaxCalculator;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace SalaryCalculator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Tests for health insurance calculator.
    /// </summary>
    [TestFixture]
    public class HealthInsuranceCalculatorTests
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Tests the calculation of health insurance with positive values.
        /// </summary>
        [Test]
        public void CalculateHealthInsurance_PositiveValues()
        {
            // Arrange
            var input = CreateTaxInputWithPositiveValues();

            // Act
            var calculator = new TaxCalculator();
            var tax = calculator.CalculateTax(input);

            // Assert
            Assert.AreEqual(1000, tax);
        }

        private TaxInput CreateTaxInputWithPositiveValues()
        {
            return new TaxInput
            {
                GrossIncome = 5000,
                HealthInsuranceCosts = 1000,
                PublicPensionRate = 0,
                UnemploymentInsuranceRate = 0,
                IncomeTaxRate = 0,
                ChurchTaxRate = 0,
                TaxType = TaxType.HealthInsurance
            };
        }
    }
}
