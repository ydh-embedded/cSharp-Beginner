# üê≥ records

In C# 9 and later, the record keyword is used to create a reference type that provides a simple way to create immutable objects.

When you declare a record class like public record class TestData(double Salary, double HealthInsuranceRate, int TaxCategory, double FreeTaxAmount, double NetSalary);, the compiler generates a class with the following characteristics:

## üê¨ 1. Immutability:
-   The properties of the record class are immutable by default, meaning their values cannot be changed after the object is created.

## üê¨ 2. Value-based equality:
-   Records have value-based equality, which means that two records are considered equal if all their properties have the same values.

## üê¨ 3. ToString() method:
-   The compiler generates a ToString() method that returns a string representation of the record, including the values of all its properties.

## üê¨ 4. Equality members:
-   The compiler generates Equals() and GetHashCode() methods that implement value-based equality.

## üê¨ 5. Copy constructor:
-   The compiler generates a copy constructor that allows you to create a copy of a record.

## üê¨ 6. Deconstructor:
-   The compiler generates a deconstructor that allows you to deconstruct a record into its individual properties.
