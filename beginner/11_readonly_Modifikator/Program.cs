                    readonly - Modifier

                    The readonly modifier prevents a member of a class
                    from being modified after construction.
                    It means that the field declared as readonly can be
                    modified only when you declare it or from within a constructor.

                    readonly fields can be initialized by the constructor
                    Readonly fields can only be initialized in their
                    declaration or within a constructor,
                    allowing for more flexibility!

                    constants should be assigned a value when declared
                    constants in C# must be assigned a value at the time of
                    declaration and cannot change!

                    Summary:

                    The readonly modifier prevents a member of
                    a class from being modified after construction.
